        <h1>One Click to Caption Web Application</h1>
    </header>
    
      <p>One Click to Caption was a web service that synchronized transcript files to videos
using the Cogi API.  The web service would also create a transcript file using the
Cogi API for those people that did not have a transcript file.
The software behind this service uploaded a video to Amazon S3 storage and then directed the Cogi API
to create a transcript of the video and then synchronized the transcript to the video.
A simple backend CMS was also implemented to allow Cogi's marketing team to update the
copy for the app without having to revise the app.
