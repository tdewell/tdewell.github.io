I've updated my personal website and moved it to GitHub.

The [Home Page](/) is a list of links to some of my favorite articles that I've saved to Evernote over the last few years.  The links are organized by topics that I'm interested in.

This website also has a few pages that show my [professional skills](/skills) and [projects](/projects) that I've worked on.
